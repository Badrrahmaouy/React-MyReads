# MyReads APP #

## Overview ##
This is a project created during the React Nanodegree Course.  
I built this app from the starter code that Udacity provided me. The app is composed by two main component:  

- The home page renders three shelves, in which are displayed the books based on the option selected ('want to read', 'currently reading' or 'read'). Books can be removed from the library by selecting the option 'none' or moved from one shelf to another by selecting the wanted option.

- The search page where the user can search books from Udacity API and add them in the home page library. The user can choose one of the three shelves to store the book in the main page.
